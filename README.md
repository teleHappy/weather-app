## Introduction
Built with React/Vite, TypeScript, responsive CSS, and JavaScript fetch. Weather Data from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and geolocation service from [LocationIQ](https://locationiq.com/geocoding). To download and run this application you will need api keys from both of these free services. I will maintain an updated version of this application running at https://rdillon.net/weather-app/.

## TODOs
- Implement unit tests for the components
- Add error handling for failed API requests
- Refactor CSS to Tailwind
